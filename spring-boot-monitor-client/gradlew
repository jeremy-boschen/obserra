#
#   Gradle start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh Gradle
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,
#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "$@", which is safe if quoted correctly.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project.
#
#       You should not edit this script directly for the following reasons:
#       - Components of the script, such as compiler configuration, Java options, build script
#         configuration, JVM settings, etc., are subject to change at any time.
#       - The behavior of the script depends on the parts defined in the template.
#       - Any changes to the script may be overwritten the next time the build script
#         runs, causing a loss of local changes.
#
#       Instead, you should do the following:
#       1. Create a custom hook that will be incorporated into the start script.
#          You can add the hook to the project or to the global Gradle user home folder (.gradle in user home).
#          - The script below calls a custom hook script located in your project at
#              gradle/scripts/custom-hooks/custom-command-line.sh
#          - You can add a global hook by placing a custom-command-line.sh script in
#              GRADLE_USER_HOME/.gradle-completion/scripts/custom-hooks
#              GRADLE_USER_HOME/gradle/scripts/custom-hooks
#          - In the example paths above, replace GRADLE_USER_HOME with the path to your Gradle user home.
#          - If any of these custom hook scripts exist, they will be invoked.
#       2. Use the appropriate environment variables and command-line arguments with the Gradle Wrapper script.
#       3. Run your own shell script that calls the Gradle Wrapper script.
